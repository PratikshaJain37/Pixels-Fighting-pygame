Logic for zero player game:

1. fill screen with 64 squares, assign array for their status
2. put half as status = 0, half as status = 1
1 = alive 0 = dead
3. now, model updates every 100 ms
if random number is greater than alive ratio, it is alive, else dead
alive ratio = numbers of players alive around them/ total no. of players around them
3B. map array to model
4. put options to display bar graph/line graph simultaneously?
